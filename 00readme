This package provides a series of user interface commands (im*
commands) and backend Perl5 libraries to integrate Email and NetNews
user interface. They are designed to be used both from Mew and on
command line.

The folder style for Mew is exactly the same as that of MH. So, you
can replace MH with this package without any migration
works. Moreover, you are able to operate your messages both by IM and
MH with consistent manner.

All programs/libraries conforms GPL2. This means, in short words, free
but no warranty. You have to provide whole source code if you
distribute. 

			  <<<Installation>>>

* Install Perl 5.004 or later if not installed. For more information,
see 00perl.

* Execute "configure".

	% ./configure

If you want to use RPOP, execute "configure" with the "--enable-rpop"
option.

	% ./configure --enable-rpop

If you specify this option, "imget" will be made as "setuid root" for
RPOP. APOP is the default. (Set Imget.Src as you like according the
syntax that "imget -h" displays.)


* To run programs in place, set IM_SYS_DIR so that they can read the
Config file.

	csh% setenv IM_SYS_DIR <dir_for_make>/cnf.im

	sh% IM_SYS_DIR=<dir_for_make>/cnf.im
	sh% export IM_SYS_DIR

	% imls


* Install them.

	% su
	# make install


* Setup "/usr/local/lib/im/SiteConfig" and "~/.im/Config". An example is
found in "cnf.im/SiteConfig" and "dot.im/Config",
respectively. 'imsetup' would help you.
